## Motion-Planning-Knight

### Knight moves with A*


![three paths](threepaths.png?raw=true)<br>
Blue path is the original A* with standard diagonal motion defined.<br>
Red path is the updated A* with standard diagonal motion defined. (note the jaggies)<br>
Green path is the updated A* with knight moves added. (no more jaggies)

The green path is shorter than the red path. Also, it is computed in fewer cycles.
